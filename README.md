This is part of the Advance Shortest Path Project by Coursera's course on Graph algorithms.Faster than traditional algorithms and accounts for finding the best route which minimizes distance and time significantly.
It Uses Bidirectional Dijkstra along with techniques such as Contraction Hierarchies algorithm and A* algorithm to find the shortest paths on real-road networks.
